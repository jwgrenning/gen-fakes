/*
    Fakes generated from: ./example-output/vs-link-errors.txt

    Generated file to help to quickly stub C++ undefined external globals.

    * One at a time
      * Add the file containing the global definition to your build or
        add the global data definition (and its declaratiob) to this file.
        Adding the global to this file is probably not sustainable, but a
        pragmatic choice until you decide how to better organioze your global
        data.
      * Add include files as neededd.
      * Work carefully. Use the compiler and link error output to test your changes.
